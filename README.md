## 🛠️ Tech Stack - Why I Chose These Technologies

### **Frontend**

- **React.js**  
  I chose **React.js** for its component-based structure, allowing for modular, scalable UI development. It ensures smooth updates and dynamic data rendering.

- **Tailwind CSS**  
  Tailwind CSS was selected for its utility-first design approach, enabling rapid UI development with minimal custom CSS.

- **React Router**  
  For seamless navigation between pages, **React Router** was essential to provide dynamic routing while preserving app state and improving user experience.

### **Backend**

- **Node.js**  
  Node.js was the ideal choice for its asynchronous nature and non-blocking I/O, ensuring scalable and efficient handling of multiple requests simultaneously.

- **Express.js**  
  Express.js simplified the backend development with its robust routing and middleware capabilities, ensuring smooth API integration.

- **Firebase**  
  Firebase was selected for its powerful yet simple authentication services, making it easier to implement secure user logins. Additionally, Firebase Hosting provided seamless deployment and ensured excellent performance.

- **MongoDB (Optional)**  
  MongoDB was considered to provide flexible schema design, essential for managing dynamic restaurant data, user profiles, and reviews efficiently.
